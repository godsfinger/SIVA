# What is it?

An artificial intelligence voice assistant that takes speech-to-text, then does text-to-speech, and does it completely for free, AND, it's open-source! (FOSS)

In it's current state it uses OpenAI's API key, but in future versions it will have it's own LLM that can converse with you about anything.
Also, currently it's borked, I'm trying to fix it and get the console windows with the speech-to-text and tts to work.
